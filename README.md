# Base Project for Typescript
This is a simple HelloWorld project using typescript. This is the nodejs way to begin with typescript and run javascript programs (not web project but can be adapted to do that).

To start working on this project:
- Check and adapt the typescript version into package.json then save this file
- run `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install` depending the package tool you like to use

From now, you can test your project by building it and run it from the command line.
Ex:
- run `node_modules/.bin/tsc main.ts; node main.js`
